# Taxonomic and Functional Annotation Guide

This directory provides comprehensive guidance on the taxonomic classification, functional annotation, and antimicrobial resistance (AMR) gene detection stages of the metagenomics pipeline.

## ðŸ”¬ Overview & Workflow

After assembling your reads into contigs, the next step is to understand "who is there?" (taxonomic classification) and "what can they do?" (functional annotation). This process is crucial for extracting biological insights from your metagenomic data.

A typical workflow involves the following steps:

1.  **Taxonomic Classification**: Assign taxonomic labels to your reads or assembled contigs to identify the organisms present in your sample. This can be done using tools like Kraken2 or Kaiju.
2.  **Gene Prediction**: Before you can determine function, you must first identify the protein-coding genes within your assembled contigs. Tools like Prodigal or Prokka are excellent for this step.
3.  **Functional Annotation**: Assign biological functions to the predicted genes. This can involve mapping them to databases of orthologous groups (eggNOG), protein families (Pfam), or metabolic pathways (KEGG).
4.  **AMR & Virulence Gene Detection**: Screen your assemblies or predicted genes against specialized databases to identify antimicrobial resistance and virulence factor genes. Tools like ABRicate and AMRFinderPlus are commonly used for this purpose.
